                    <h2>1) What is an interview?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                           An interview is a formal conversation between two or more people, typically with one
                            person, the interviewer, asking questions to obtain information, assess qualifications,
                            or
                            evaluate the suitability of a candidate for a job, admission, or other purposes.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p><span>
                            An interview is an opportunity for a potential employer to learn more about you. In most
                            cases, it takes the form of a question-based discussion. It is an opportunity for you to
                            talk about why you would be a good candidate for the position. Many people describe an
                            interview as an opportunity to “sell yourself”. An interview is a kind of oral argument
                            about why you are a strong candidate for a particular position.

                <h2>2)Different type of the interview </h2>
                <p><span>
                        There are several types of interviews based on their purpose, format, and context. Here are
                        some common types of interviews:
                    </span></p>
                <img src="/assets/image.png" height="500px" alt="types">
                <p><span>
                        <b>1. Job Interview:</b> This is the most common type, where a candidate is assessed for a
                        specific
                        job role. It can be structured (with a set list of questions) or unstructured (more
                        conversational). Job interviews can also include behavioral interviews (focus on past
                        behavior) or situational interviews (assess how candidates would handle hypothetical
                        situations).</span></p>
                <p><span>
                        <b>2. Panel Interview:</b> In a panel interview, a candidate is interviewed by a group of
                        interviewers, usually from different departments or levels within the organization. Panel
                        interviews are common for senior-level positions or when multiple perspectives are needed.
                    </span></p>
                <p><span><b>3. Telephone/Video Interview:</b> These interviews are conducted over the phone or
                        through video
                        conferencing platforms like Zoom or Skype. They are often used as initial screenings before
                        in-person interviews, especially for remote positions or candidates who are geographically
                        distant.</span></p>
                <p> <span> <b>4. Technical Interview:</b> Commonly used in technical fields like software
                        development or
                        engineering, a technical interview assesses a candidate's technical skills, problem-solving
                        abilities, and knowledge of specific technologies or tools.
                    </span></p>
                <p> <span><b> 5. Behavioral Interview:</b> In a behavioral interview, candidates are asked to
                        provide examples
                        of past behaviors or experiences to demonstrate their skills, competencies, and suitability
                        for the job. Employers believe that past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior.
                    </span></p>
                <p> <span><b>6. Case Interview:</b>This type of interview is common in consulting and
                        business-related
                        roles. Candidates are presented with a business case or problem and are asked to analyze it,
                        develop a solution, and present their recommendations to the interviewer.
                    </span> </p>
                <p><span><b>7. Group Interview:</b> In a group interview, multiple candidates are interviewed
                        together,
                        often participating in group activities or discussions. Employers use this format to observe
                        how candidates interact, collaborate, and communicate in a group setting.
                    </span></p>
                <p> <span><b> 8. Stress Interview:</b> This type of interview is designed to put candidates under
                        pressure or
                        stress to assess how they handle challenging situations, pressure, or conflict. It's not as
                        common as other interview types and is sometimes considered controversial.
                    </span></p>
                <p><span><b>9. Informational Interview:</b> Unlike other types focused on job candidacy, an
                        informational
                        interview is when someone seeks information and advice from a professional in their field of
                        interest. It's more about networking and gathering insights than a formal assessment.
                    </span></p>
